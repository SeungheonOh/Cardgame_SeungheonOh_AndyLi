# BS
## Rule
You and Computer place one card in each turn.
The objective is to place correct ordered card (A to 10 and JQK, card class doesn't matter). 
So, for example, if 7 Spade is on top of the deck, player should place either 7 of any class or 8 of any class.
However, Players won't always have a card they need. They can BS other players--on their risk. If you BSed computer 
and get caught by computer, you will lose. To be fair, Computer will also make a BS and you will be able to catch 
computer and easily win the match. Good luck.
